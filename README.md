# Sonitus
Noise-controls like **native**, but for _non-Apple_ devices that update when you change modes on the headphones.
Simply select your device and you're ready to go.

## Known supported headphones/earbuds:
### Sony:
- WH-1000XM3 / WH-1000XM4
- WF-1000XM4
- WI-C600N
### Bose:
- Bose QC35
- Bose NC700
### Anker Soundcore:

> This tweak was tested using Sony WF-1000xm4 so all the sony headphones should work. The others should still have the noise-controls but the slider might not sync with the headphones.

Let me know if your device is supported but I haven't put it on the list yet :)  
Would you like to see other headphones supported as well? Open an issue (or open a pull request), or DM me on Twitter.

## Does it work with other noise cancellation tweaks?
Yes! Sonitus should work just fine with other noise cancellation (automation) tweaks, because it emulates the behavior of the official Airpods pro.

## What is the difference between Sonitus and Sonitus Reborn?
When using sonitus the noise cancelation slider on the phone will not change if the noise cancelling mode is changed from the head phones. Sonitus Reborn checks what mode the headphones are in every 5 seconds (By defult). This can be changed in the preferences. (for Sony headphones). However, the more often Sonitus Reborn checks the mode the head phones are in the more battery is consumes. (Not tested but seems likely)
